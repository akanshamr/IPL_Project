I have created a Django project for IPL report in Pycharm.


To access the project, it is better to use a virtual directory as it will keep the django version in your computer and the one used in this project seperate.

Create virtual environment and activate the environment.

create virtual environment - python3 -m venv env
activate virtual environment - source env/bin/activate

Install the requirements for the project

Command - pip install -r requirements.txt


Command for running

>> python manage.py runserver
